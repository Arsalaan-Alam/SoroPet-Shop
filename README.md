### SoroPet Shop
In this tutorial, I’ve built a fully functional Pet Shop application on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. The Pet Shop is a familiar concept for many developers, especially those coming from Ethereum’s ecosystem, but this tutorial reimagines it on the Stellar network using Soroban, a new smart contract platform. The application allows users to adopt and disown pets, with ownership stored on the blockchain. This tutorial guides developers step-by-step on how to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on Stellar using Rust & React providing a comprehensive introduction to building decentralized applications on Soroban.
